# OpenAPI

Vapi provides an OpenAPI specification that describes our API endpoints and operations. You can use this specification to generate client libraries, explore the API, and more.

## Accessing the OpenAPI Specification

The OpenAPI specification for Vapi's API is available at:

```
https://api.vapi.ai/openapi.json
```

You can use this URL to import the specification into API tools and documentation generators.

## Key Endpoints

Some of the key endpoints described in the OpenAPI specification include:

- `/v1/calls`: Endpoints for managing calls
- `/v1/assistants`: Endpoints for working with AI assistants
- `/v1/phone_numbers`: Endpoints for managing phone numbers

## Create a Call Endpoint

The "Create a Call" endpoint allows you to programmatically initiate outbound calls. The summary for this endpoint has been updated to:

"Create an outbound call or start a web call session"

This reflects that the endpoint can be used both for traditional outbound phone calls as well as web-based call sessions.

## Using the OpenAPI Specification

You can use the OpenAPI specification to:

1. Generate client libraries in various programming languages
2. Explore the API structure and available operations
3. Set up automated testing
4. Create custom documentation or integrate with API management tools

## Keeping Up-to-Date

The OpenAPI specification is regularly updated as new features are added or existing endpoints are modified. Be sure to check for updates periodically to ensure you're working with the latest API information.
