## Additional Information

The Swagger documentation provides a interactive interface for exploring and testing our API endpoints. Some key benefits of using the Swagger UI include:

- Visual representation of all available API resources
- Ability to send requests and see responses directly in the browser
- Automatic generation of request samples in multiple programming languages
- Easy-to-read API method documentation

To access the full OpenAPI specification, please refer to our [OpenAPI documentation](api-reference/openapi).

## Usage Tips

- Use the "Authorize" button at the top to authenticate and access protected endpoints
- Expand each endpoint to see details on parameters, request body schema, and response formats
- Click "Try it out" on any endpoint to test it live against our API
