## Overview

Vapi provides a comprehensive OpenAPI specification that describes all available API endpoints, request/response schemas, and authentication methods. This specification serves as the foundation for our API documentation, SDK generation, and developer tooling.

<Check>
  Our OpenAPI specification is hosted at
  [https://api.vapi.ai/api-json](https://api.vapi.ai/api-json)
</Check>

## What's Included

The OpenAPI specification includes detailed information about:

- **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication methods
- **Endpoints**: All REST API endpoints for managing assistants, calls, tools, and more
- **Request Schemas**: Complete data models for API requests
- **Response Schemas**: Detailed response formats and error codes
- **Parameters**: Query parameters, path parameters, and request body specifications

### SDK Generation

The OpenAPI specification is used to generate our official SDKs across multiple programming languages:

- [TypeScript/JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/VapiAI/server-sdk-typescript)
- [Python SDK](https://github.com/VapiAI/server-sdk-python)
- [Java SDK](https://github.com/VapiAI/server-sdk-java)
- [Ruby SDK](https://github.com/VapiAI/server-sdk-ruby)
- [C# SDK](https://github.com/VapiAI/server-sdk-csharp)
- [Go SDK](https://github.com/VapiAI/server-sdk-go)

### Custom Tooling

You can use the OpenAPI specification to generate your own client libraries, documentation, or testing tools using popular OpenAPI generators like:

- [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/)
- [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/)
- [Fern](https://buildwithfern.com/)

## Recent Updates

The OpenAPI specification is regularly updated to reflect new features, endpoint changes, and improvements to the Vapi platform. Recent significant updates include:

- Enhanced assistant configuration options
- New workflow and blocks functionality
- Expanded call management capabilities
- Additional provider integrations
- Improved error handling and response schemas

## Validation and Standards

Our OpenAPI specification follows OpenAPI 3.0 standards and is regularly validated to ensure:

- **Accuracy**: All endpoints and schemas match actual API behavior
- **Completeness**: Full coverage of available functionality
- **Consistency**: Standardized naming conventions and patterns
- **Compatibility**: Support for common OpenAPI tooling
