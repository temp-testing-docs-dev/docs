## About Our OpenAPI Specification

Vapi's OpenAPI specification provides a comprehensive definition of our REST API endpoints, request/response schemas, and authentication methods. The specification follows OpenAPI 3.0 standards and is automatically generated from our codebase to ensure accuracy and up-to-date documentation.

## Using the OpenAPI Specification

You can use our OpenAPI specification to:

- **Generate client SDKs** in your preferred programming language
- **Import into API testing tools** like Postman, Insomnia, or Swagger UI
- **Validate API requests and responses** in your applications
- **Understand available endpoints** and their parameters

## Key API Endpoints

Our OpenAPI specification includes documentation for all major Vapi endpoints, including:

- **Calls** - Create and manage phone calls
- **Assistants** - Configure AI voice assistants
- **Phone Numbers** - Manage phone number resources
- **Tools** - Define custom functions for assistants
- **Squads** - Multi-assistant conversation workflows

## Integration Examples

You can integrate with our API using the OpenAPI specification directly or through our pre-built SDKs. Here's a quick example of how to use the specification with common tools:

### Postman Integration

1. Open Postman and click "Import"
2. Enter the URL: `https://api.vapi.ai/api-json`
3. Postman will automatically create a collection with all available endpoints

### SDK Generation

Use tools like OpenAPI Generator to create client libraries:

```bash
openapi-generator-cli generate \
  -i https://api.vapi.ai/api-json \
  -g python \
  -o ./vapi-client
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using your Vapi API key. The OpenAPI specification includes the security schemes and authentication requirements for each endpoint.

## Stay Updated

Our OpenAPI specification is automatically updated whenever we release new features or make changes to the API. Bookmark the URL to always access the latest version.
