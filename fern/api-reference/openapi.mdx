## What's New

Our OpenAPI specification has been significantly updated with comprehensive improvements and additions. The specification now includes enhanced endpoint documentation, improved data models, and expanded API coverage to better serve your development needs.

## Using the OpenAPI Specification

The OpenAPI specification provides a complete reference for all available API endpoints, request/response schemas, and authentication methods. You can use this specification to:

- Generate client libraries in your preferred programming language
- Import into API testing tools like Postman or Insomnia
- Integrate with API documentation tools
- Validate API requests and responses

## Integration Examples

You can easily integrate our OpenAPI specification into your development workflow:

```bash
# Download the OpenAPI specification
curl https://api.vapi.ai/api-json -o vapi-openapi.json
```

```javascript
// Example: Using the specification with OpenAPI Generator
// Generate a client library for your preferred language
npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \
  -i https://api.vapi.ai/api-json \
  -g javascript \
  -o ./vapi-client
