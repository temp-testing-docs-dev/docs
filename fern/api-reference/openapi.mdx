# OpenAPI Specification

Vapi provides an OpenAPI specification that describes our API endpoints, request/response structures, and authentication requirements. This specification can be used to generate client libraries, explore the API, and integrate Vapi into your applications.

## Accessing the OpenAPI Specification

<Check>
  Our OpenAPI specification is hosted at:
  [https://api.vapi.ai/api-json](https://api.vapi.ai/api-json)
</Check>

You can use this URL to:

1. Import the specification into API development tools like Postman or Insomnia
2. Generate client libraries for various programming languages
3. Explore the available endpoints and their parameters

## Using the OpenAPI Specification

### Importing into API Tools

Most modern API development tools support importing OpenAPI specifications. To use Vapi's specification:

1. Open your preferred API tool (e.g., Postman, Insomnia)
2. Look for an option to import an API or OpenAPI specification
3. Enter the URL: `https://api.vapi.ai/api-json`
4. Follow the tool's instructions to complete the import

### Generating Client Libraries

Many tools and libraries can generate client code based on OpenAPI specifications. For example:

- [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/): Supports multiple programming languages
- [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/): Another popular option for code generation

To generate a client library:

1. Install your chosen generator tool
2. Run the generator, pointing it to `https://api.vapi.ai/api-json`
3. Select your target programming language
4. Follow the tool's instructions to complete the code generation

### Exploring the API

You can also use online tools to explore the Vapi API without leaving your browser:

1. Visit [Swagger UI](https://petstore.swagger.io/)
2. Enter `https://api.vapi.ai/api-json` in the explore box
3. Browse the available endpoints, request/response structures, and try out API calls

## Keeping Up-to-Date

The OpenAPI specification is automatically updated when changes are made to the Vapi API. Always refer to the hosted specification URL to ensure you're working with the most current version.
