## Overview

Voiceflow is a conversational AI platform that helps teams build, manage, and deploy AI agents, especially chatbots, to enhance customer experiences. It enables users to create advanced AI chatbots without coding, using a user-friendly drag-and-drop flow builder. This feature allows businesses to customize chatbot interactions and efficiently automate customer support processes.

To link Vapi with Voiceflow, host a proxy using Voiceflow's AI features. This proxy handles requests from Voiceflow, sends them to Vapi's text completion API, and returns Vapi's responses to Voiceflow. You'll need to host this proxy on your server to manage communication between Vapi and Voiceflow.

## Workshop

The workshop conducted by Vapi in collaboration with Voiceflow provided an in-depth exploration of building voice agents using the Voiceflow platform, deployed through Vapi. During this session, participants learned how to create voice agents that leverage Voiceflow's user-friendly design tools alongside Vapi's voice capabilities. The workshop featured a live demonstration, where attendees could see the entire process of building a voice agent in real-time, including designing the agent, setting up necessary integrations, and testing functionality.
