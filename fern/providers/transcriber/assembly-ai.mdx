**The Evolution of AI Transcription:**

Speech recognition has evolved from basic systems to sophisticated AI models capable of understanding diverse languages and accents. AssemblyAI has been at the forefront of this evolution, developing models like Universal-2, trained on over 12.5 million hours of audio data, achieving best-in-class transcription accuracy across several industry-critical languages. 

**Overview of AssemblyAI's Offerings:**

AssemblyAI offers a comprehensive suite of AI-driven tools designed to meet diverse needs:

**Speech-To-Text**

- Their core offering converts spoken language into written text with up to 95% accuracy and 30% less hallucinations than other leaders in the space.

**Audio Intelligence**

- Beyond transcription, AssemblyAI's fully featured speech understanding models can analyze audio to detect sentiment, identify topics, and perform speaker diarization, transforming words into meaningful ideas, insights, and opportunities.

**Real-time Transcription**

- AssemblyAI's real-time transcription feature enables sub-second latency conversion of speech to text, beneficial for live captioning, customer support, and interactive voice response systems, enhancing user experience and operational efficiency.

## Configuring AssemblyAI Transcriber

To use AssemblyAI as your transcriber provider, configure your assistant with the following settings:

```json
{
  "transcriber": {
    "provider": "assembly-ai",
    "enableUniversalStreamingApi": true
  }
}
```

### enableUniversalStreamingApi

The `enableUniversalStreamingApi` property is a new configuration option for AssemblyAI transcriber that allows you to enable their Universal Streaming API. This property is optional and defaults to `false` if not specified.

**When to use:**
- **Enable (`true`)**: Use when you need the most accurate transcription results and can accept slightly higher latency. The Universal Streaming API provides improved accuracy for diverse languages and accents.
- **Disable (`false`)**: Use when you need the lowest possible latency for real-time applications where speed is more critical than maximum accuracy.

**Example configurations:**

**High Accuracy Configuration:**
```json
{
  "transcriber": {
    "provider": "assembly-ai",
    "enableUniversalStreamingApi": true,
    "language": "en"
  }
}
```

**Low Latency Configuration:**
```json
{
  "transcriber": {
    "provider": "assembly-ai",
    "enableUniversalStreamingApi": false,
    "language": "en"
  }
}
```
