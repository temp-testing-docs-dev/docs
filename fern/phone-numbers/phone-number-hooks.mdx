# Phone Number Hooks

Phone number hooks allow you to configure actions that will be performed when specific events occur on a phone number. This feature is similar to assistant hooks but applies to phone numbers instead.

## Usage

Hooks are defined in the `hooks` array of a phone number. Each hook consists of:

- `on`: The event that triggers the hook (currently supports `call.incoming`)
- `do`: The actions to perform when the hook triggers (supports `transfer` and `say`)
- `filters`: Optional conditions that must be met for the hook to trigger

## Example: Transfer Incoming Calls

This example shows how to transfer incoming calls to a specific phone number:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.vapi.ai/phone-number/<id>" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <auth>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
  "hooks": [{
    "on": "call.incoming",
    "do": [{
      "type": "transfer",
      "destination": {
        "type": "number",
        "number": "+1234567890",
        "callerId": "+1987654321"
      }
    }]
  }]
}'
```

You can also transfer to a SIP destination:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.vapi.ai/phone-number/<id>" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <auth>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
  "hooks": [{
    "on": "call.incoming",
    "do": [{
      "type": "transfer",
      "destination": {
        "type": "sip",
        "sipUri": "sip:user@domain.com"
      }
    }]
  }]
}'
```

## Example: Greet and Transfer

This example demonstrates how to greet the caller with a message and then transfer the call:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.vapi.ai/phone-number/<id>" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <auth>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
  "hooks": [{
    "on": "call.incoming",
    "do": [
      {
        "type": "say",
        "exact": "Welcome to our service. We are transferring your call to an agent."
      },
      {
        "type": "transfer",
        "destination": {
          "type": "number",
          "number": "+1234567890",
          "callerId": "+1987654321"
        }
      }
    ]
  }]
}'
```

## Filtering Incoming Calls

You can use filters to apply hooks only to specific incoming calls. For example, to transfer calls only from a specific number:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.vapi.ai/phone-number/<id>" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <auth>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
  "hooks": [{
    "on": "call.incoming",
    "filters": [{
      "type": "equals",
      "key": "from",
      "value": "+1987654321"
    }],
    "do": [{
      "type": "transfer",
      "destination": {
        "type": "number",
        "number": "+1234567890",
        "callerId": "+1987654321"
      }
    }]
  }]
}'
```

## Common Use Cases

Phone number hooks can be used for various purposes, including:

- Routing calls to different destinations based on the caller's number
- Providing custom greetings for specific callers
- Implementing basic IVR (Interactive Voice Response) functionality
- Load balancing incoming calls across multiple destinations

By leveraging phone number hooks, you can create more flexible and powerful call handling solutions that meet your specific business needs.
