title: API Enhancements - April 15, 2025
slug: changelog/2025-04-15

1. **AssemblyAI Universal Streaming API Support**: You can now configure AssemblyAI's Universal Streaming API to improve transcription accuracy and performance. Specify `AssemblyAITranscriber.useUniversalStreaming` to enable this enhanced streaming model for better real-time speech recognition.

2. **Transfer Tool Timeout Configuration**: Added timeout settings for call transfer operations. You can now configure `TransferTool.timeoutSeconds` to control how long the system waits during transfer attempts before timing out. This provides better control over call flow and prevents indefinite transfer delays.

3. **Analysis Plan Message Threshold**: Introduced `AnalysisPlan.messageThreshold` to control when call analysis is triggered based on the number of messages exchanged during a call. Set this threshold to ensure analysis only runs on substantive conversations, helping optimize processing resources and focus on meaningful interactions.
