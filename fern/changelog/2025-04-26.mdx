# Changelog - April 26, 2025

We're excited to announce the following updates and improvements to the Vapi platform:

## New Features

### Enhanced Voice Fallback Plan

We've improved our Voice Fallback Plan to provide even more reliability for your voice applications. The system now intelligently selects backup voices based on similarity to the primary voice, ensuring a smoother transition if fallback is required.

- Automatic voice similarity matching
- Configurable fallback cascade with up to 3 backup voices
- Real-time monitoring and instant fallback activation

For more information, see our updated [Voice Fallback Plan](./voice-fallback-plan) documentation.

### Custom Keyword Boosting for Multilingual Transcription

Our transcription engine now supports custom keyword boosting for multiple languages, improving accuracy for domain-specific terminology across various linguistic contexts.

- Support for up to 10 languages per assistant
- Easy keyword management through our updated dashboard
- Significant improvement in transcription accuracy for specialized vocabularies

Check out the [Custom Keywords](./customization/custom-keywords) guide to learn how to implement this feature.

## Improvements

### Workflow Editor UI Enhancements

We've revamped the Workflow Editor user interface to improve usability and efficiency:

- Drag-and-drop functionality for faster node placement
- Improved zoom and pan controls for easier navigation of complex workflows
- New node grouping feature for better organization of large workflows

### API Performance Boost

We've optimized our backend infrastructure, resulting in:

- 30% reduction in API response times
- Increased stability during high-load periods
- Improved rate limiting with more granular controls

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where some custom voice models were not properly loading in certain edge cases
- Resolved a bug in the Web SDK that occasionally caused audio playback delays
- Corrected a minor display issue in the analytics dashboard for calls spanning multiple days

## Deprecations

- The legacy `v1/calls` API endpoint will be deprecated on July 1, 2025. Please migrate to the `v2/calls` endpoint as soon as possible. Refer to our [API migration guide](./api-reference/migration-v1-to-v2) for assistance.

We're constantly working to improve Vapi and provide you with the best possible experience. As always, we appreciate your feedback and suggestions. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.

Happy building!
