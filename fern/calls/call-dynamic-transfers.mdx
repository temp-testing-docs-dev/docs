## Before you start

Prerequisites:
- Access to a server or cloud function that can receive requests from Vapi

## Overview

Dynamic call transfers let your assistant transfer calls to different destinations (phone numbers, SIP, or other assistants) based on real-time context. This guide shows you how to set up a custom transfer tool, connect it to your assistant, handle transfer requests with your server, and respond with the right destination or error.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a custom transfer tool">
    Create a transfer tool with an empty `destinations` array. This acts as a placeholder so you can define destinations dynamically at runtime.
    
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.vapi.ai/tool \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer insert-private-key-here" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{
      "type": "transferCall",
      "destinations": [],
      "function": {
        "name": "dynamicDestinationTransferCall"
      }
    }'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Link the tool to your assistant">
    After creating the tool, link it to your assistant. This enables the assistant to trigger the tool during calls.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the server event">
    In your assistant settings, select the `transfer-destination-request` server event. This event sends a webhook to your server whenever a transfer is requested, so you can dynamically determine the destination.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up your server to handle transfer requests">
    Update your assistant's server URL to point to your server. Your server will receive a webhook with call details whenever a transfer is triggered, and should respond with the appropriate destination or an error.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger the tool and process requests">
    Use a prompt like this to trigger the transfer tool:
    
    ```
    [TASK]
    trigger the dynamicDestinationTransferCall tool
    ```
    
    When triggered, the assistant sends a `transfer-destination-request` webhook to your server. The webhook includes call details, transcripts, and messages.
    
    **Sample request payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "type": "transfer-destination-request",
      "artifact": {
        "messages": [...],
        "transcript": "Hello, how can I help you?",
        "messagesOpenAIFormatted": [...]
      },
      "assistant": { "id": "assistant123" },
      "phoneNumber": "+14155552671",
      "customer": { "id": "customer456" },
      "call": { "id": "call789", "status": "ongoing" }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Respond to transfer requests">
    Your server should respond with either a valid `destination` or an `error`.
    
    #### Number destination example
    ```json
    {
      "destination": {
        "type": "number",
        "message": "Connecting you to our support line.",
        "number": "+14155552671",
        "numberE164CheckEnabled": true,
        "callerId": "+14155551234",
        "extension": "101",
        "timeout": 30
      }
    }
    ```
    
    #### SIP destination example
    ```json
    {
      "destination": {
        "type": "sip",
        "message": "Connecting your call via SIP.",
        "sipUri": "sip:customer-support@domain.com",
        "sipHeaders": {
          "X-Custom-Header": "value"
        },
        "timeout": 45
      }
    }
    ```
    
    #### Error response example
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Invalid destination specified."
    }
    ```
    Every response must include either a `destination` or an `error` to indicate the outcome of the transfer request.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Transfer Timeout Configuration

The `timeout` property allows you to specify how long (in seconds) the system should wait for the transfer destination to answer before considering the transfer failed. This is particularly useful for managing call flow and user experience.

### Timeout Behavior

- **Default timeout**: If no timeout is specified, the system uses a default timeout value
- **Timeout range**: The timeout value should typically be between 10-60 seconds
- **Timeout exceeded**: If the destination doesn't answer within the specified timeout, the call returns to the assistant
- **Immediate answer**: If the destination answers before the timeout, the transfer completes successfully

### Usage Examples

#### Number destination with timeout
```json
{
  "destination": {
    "type": "number",
    "number": "+14155552671",
    "message": "Connecting you to our sales team.",
    "timeout": 20
  }
}
```

#### SIP destination with timeout
```json
{
  "destination": {
    "type": "sip",
    "sipUri": "sip:support@company.com",
    "message": "Transferring you to technical support.",
    "timeout": 30
  }
}
```

### Best Practices for Timeout Configuration

- **Customer service lines**: Use shorter timeouts (15-25 seconds) to avoid long wait times
- **Internal transfers**: Use longer timeouts (30-45 seconds) for internal extensions that may take longer to answer
- **Emergency lines**: Use shorter timeouts (10-15 seconds) with fallback options
- **Automated systems**: Use longer timeouts (45-60 seconds) for IVR systems that may need processing time

### Handling Timeout Scenarios

When a transfer times out, you can implement fallback logic:

```json
{
  "destination": {
    "type": "number",
    "number": "+14155552671",
    "message": "Connecting you to our support team.",
    "timeout": 25,
    "fallbackMessage": "The support team is currently unavailable. Let me help you with your request."
  }
}
```

<Note>
The timeout property is optional. If not specified, the system will use the default timeout configured for your account.
</Note>

## Conclusion

Dynamic call transfers with timeout configuration empower your assistant to route calls efficiently based on real-time data while maintaining control over call flow timing. By implementing transfer timeouts, you can ensure seamless interactions and provide a better experience for your users, even when transfer destinations are unavailable.
