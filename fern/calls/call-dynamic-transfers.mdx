## Before you start

Prerequisites:
- Access to a server or cloud function that can receive requests from Vapi

## Overview

Dynamic call transfers let your assistant transfer calls to different destinations (phone numbers, SIP, or other assistants) based on real-time context. This guide shows you how to set up a custom transfer tool, connect it to your assistant, handle transfer requests with your server, and respond with the right destination or error.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a custom transfer tool">
    Create a transfer tool with an empty `destinations` array. This acts as a placeholder so you can define destinations dynamically at runtime.
    
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.vapi.ai/tool \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer insert-private-key-here" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{
      "type": "transferCall",
      "destinations": [],
      "function": {
        "name": "dynamicDestinationTransferCall"
      }
    }'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Link the tool to your assistant">
    After creating the tool, link it to your assistant. This enables the assistant to trigger the tool during calls.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the server event">
    In your assistant settings, select the `transfer-destination-request` server event. This event sends a webhook to your server whenever a transfer is requested, so you can dynamically determine the destination.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up your server to handle transfer requests">
    Update your assistant's server URL to point to your server. Your server will receive a webhook with call details whenever a transfer is triggered, and should respond with the appropriate destination or an error.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger the tool and process requests">
    Use a prompt like this to trigger the transfer tool:
    
    ```
    [TASK]
    trigger the dynamicDestinationTransferCall tool
    ```
    
    When triggered, the assistant sends a `transfer-destination-request` webhook to your server. The webhook includes call details, transcripts, and messages.
    
    **Sample request payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "type": "transfer-destination-request",
      "artifact": {
        "messages": [...],
        "transcript": "Hello, how can I help you?",
        "messagesOpenAIFormatted": [...]
      },
      "assistant": { "id": "assistant123" },
      "phoneNumber": "+14155552671",
      "customer": { "id": "customer456" },
      "call": { "id": "call789", "status": "ongoing" }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Respond to transfer requests">
    Your server should respond with either a valid `destination` or an `error`.
    
    #### Number destination example
    ```json
    {
      "destination": {
        "type": "number",
        "message": "Connecting you to our support line.",
        "number": "+14155552671",
        "numberE164CheckEnabled": true,
        "callerId": "+14155551234",
        "extension": "101",
        "timeout": 30
      }
    }
    ```
    
    #### SIP destination example
    ```json
    {
      "destination": {
        "type": "sip",
        "message": "Connecting your call via SIP.",
        "sipUri": "sip:customer-support@domain.com",
        "sipHeaders": {
          "X-Custom-Header": "value"
        },
        "timeout": 45
      }
    }
    ```
    
    #### Error response example
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Invalid destination specified."
    }
    ```
    Every response must include either a `destination` or an `error` to indicate the outcome of the transfer request.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Timeout Configuration

When configuring warm transfer operations, you can specify a timeout value to control how long the transfer will wait before timing out. This is particularly useful for ensuring transfers don't hang indefinitely if the destination doesn't answer.

### Setting Transfer Timeout

You can configure the timeout using the `timeout` property in your transfer destination:

```json
{
  "destination": {
    "type": "number",
    "number": "+14155552671",
    "timeout": 120
  }
}
```

### Timeout Parameters

- **Valid Range**: 1-600 seconds
- **Default Value**: 60 seconds
- **Purpose**: Controls how long the system waits for the transfer destination to be established before timing out

### Example Configurations

#### Short timeout for quick screening
```json
{
  "destination": {
    "type": "number",
    "number": "+14155552671",
    "timeout": 15,
    "message": "Quickly connecting you to our support team."
  }
}
```

#### Extended timeout for complex transfers
```json
{
  "destination": {
    "type": "sip",
    "sipUri": "sip:support@company.com",
    "timeout": 300,
    "message": "Please hold while we establish your connection."
  }
}
```

#### Using maximum timeout
```json
{
  "destination": {
    "type": "number",
    "number": "+14155552671",
    "timeout": 600,
    "message": "Connecting you to our specialized support team."
  }
}
```

<Note>
If no timeout is specified, the system will use the default value of 60 seconds. The timeout applies specifically to warm transfer operations and helps prevent calls from hanging indefinitely when destinations are unreachable.
</Note>

## Conclusion

Dynamic call transfers empower your assistant to route calls efficiently based on real-time data. By implementing this flow with proper timeout configuration, you can ensure seamless interactions and provide a better experience for your users while maintaining control over transfer durations.
